    Windows Security Auditing generates event logs when specific actions occur, including authentication, process execution, account changes, policy changes and object access. Without a deliberate audit policy, important security events may not be generated or retained.

    ASD recommends configuring Windows event logging and forwarding to improve detection, investigation and incident response. The entries below reconcile the app's reference content against ASD's Windows event logging and forwarding guidance, last updated 6 October 2021.

    Configure these settings through Group Policy at Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration, or validate them with auditpol.exe. Test logging volume and forwarding impact before broad deployment.
